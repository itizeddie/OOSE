### Attendance and contribution
[5 points] (Anyone missing without an advanced excuse?  Everyone doing at least some talking?)
Check. Satisfactory.

### Overview of project
[10 points] (Clearly explained and understandable?  Got us at least a little excited about the app?)
The idea of the app was motivated well. It is sort exciting to have a meta app over Gradescope.

### Demo
[25 points] (Clear?  No glitches?  Live or recorded? Good progress shown?)
Live demo, which was a plus but the presentation had a few glitches. Need better visualisations.

### Architecture
[5 points] (Explained clearly if its non-standard?)
Good

### Code review / UML diagram
[5 points] (Some interesting code or algorithm explained well?)
Should have explained perl crawler.
(-1)

### Presentation organization
[10 points] (Presentation started promptly? Flow was smooth from speaker to speaker?  No need to huddle mid-presentation to decide what to do next?)
Flow was smooth.

### Talking
[15 points] (Easy to understand speech and points being made?)
Fine

### Quality of slides
