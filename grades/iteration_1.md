## Iteration 1 Evaluation - Group 11

**Evaluator: [Lal, Yash Kumar](mailto:ylal1@jhu.edu)**

### The project idea

Solid idea. Useful for end users.

### Features
(Do features align with vision, UI sketches, and use-cases? Are there non-CRUD features?)

Listed features are in tune with vision statement and UI sketches. However, there is a lack of non-CRUD features which has to be addressed, for the web app.

### UI sketches

UI sketches line up with the listed features, which have to be changed, and so UI sketches will have to be updated to reflect the same.

### Use Cases

Use cases are described well, and in detail. Some webapp features, when beefed up, have to be included in next iteration submission.

### Architecture

System design is rigorous but since it involves scraping, prototyping phase will be intensive. Should still be feasible but that is a critical point in the project.

### General Remarks

Group targeted too many platforms across all browser. Should focus their efforts on one platform (maybe Blackboard?) and one browser (ideally, Firefox) to begin with. Extending it will be a plus. Visualisations and insights will matter more.

**Grade: 88/100**
