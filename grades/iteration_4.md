# Iteration 4 Evaluation - Group 11

**Evaluator: [Lal, Yash Kumar](mailto:yash@jhu.edu)**

### Implementation progress
[30 points] (More features working?  Improved demo running?  Good progress on non-CRUD including  integration? Project is looking to have appropriate degree of difficulty overall?)

(-5) Still can't see any graphs planned. Implementation may be done later but you should be have a clear and valid general idea about it.

#### Code Quality
[10 points] (Good file and package structure?  Good use of object-oriented design principles thus far in codebase?  Correct use of frameworks?  DRY not happening?)

### Testing
[20 points] (A fully functioning test harness using good code methodology in terms of test setup and tear-down?)

#### Test coverage
[10 points] Good coverage with tests?

#### Travis
[5 points] (Travis-CI integration tests working?  Tests are at integration level?)

#### Fully automated build of your project with a README.md describing how to build it
[5 points]

### Deployment
[5 points] (Server deployed and working on Heroku or AWS or other?)

### Advanced Git usage
[10 points] (Still being good about regular commits, pull requests, etc?  Additionally, development primarily taking place on feature branches, no personal-named branches, good git workflow overall?)

### Iteration submission and reporting

#### CHANGELOG.md updated and project boards updated, filling in goals for iterations 5 and 6
[5 points]

### Other Remarks

flin27's commits look a little light to me. I have not cut points this time, but I'll be keeping an eye out.

**Grade: 95/100**
