# Iteration 3 Evaluation - Group 11

**Evaluator: [Lal, Yash Kumar](mailto:yash@jhu.edu)**

### Implementation progress
[30 points] 
(Enough code progress?  Dev stack all stood up, and a few core features working?  Front- and back-end hooked up to each other at all?  Some progress on non-CRUD features?)
25/30 - Need substantial progress on non-CRUD features.

### Design check-in
[10 points]
(Is the project on-track in terms of the evolved design?  It is still a good amount of work given how it has evolved?  Are there flaws emerging in the design, or features that should be added or removed?)
10/10

### Code Quality
[10 points]
(Good file structure?  Good use of object-oriented design principles thus far in codebase?  Correct use of frameworks?  Are there other frameworks or tools you should be using that you are not now?)
10/10

### General Git usage
[10 points]
(Group members are all being good about regular commits, use of branches, pull requests, good .gitignore, etc?  All members contributing?)
7/10 - 2 users lacking commits, not merged with master

#### Use of the GitHub issue tracker to manage bugs, features, etc.
[5 points]
5/5

#### Codebase pushed to master on your team's GitHub repository for our inspection
[5 points]
5/5

### Iteration submission and reporting

#### Fully automated build of your project with a README.md describing how to build it
[5 points]
(Could we successfully build the project from the README alone?)
5/5

#### Top-level file CHANGELOG.md present in your repo and describes progress in this iteration well
[5 points]
5/5

#### Use of GitHub's project boards to keep track of your progress
[10 points]
(You need to have a column for each iteration, and to have sketched out what future iteration you are going to implement the various features.  You need to have very clear goals for the next iteration (4).  Also any features not implemented in iteration 3 need to be moved to iteration 4.  You need to have at least some features penciled in for iterations 5 and 6.)
7/10 - Project board needs updating as for future goals and demarcation per iteration.

### Other Remarks
