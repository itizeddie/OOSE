# Iteration 2 Evaluation - Group 11

**Evaluator: [Lal, Yash Kumar](mailto:yash@jhu.edu)**

### Features and use-cases
[15 points]  (Modifications if any from requirements are good?  Key and extended features marked as was required in the assignment?)
All in line.

### UI sketches
[15 points]  (Improved as either needed or required based on iteration 1 feedback?)
Still look very hand-wavy and vague at points. For example, the screen with courses on the left and calendar in the center. It needs actual content. (-8)

### Endpoint and/or other interface documentation
[20 points]  (Complete relative to UI sketches, UML, etc?  JSON in/out shown?)
Looks good.

### UML Class diagram
[15 points]  (Good coverage of features?  Proper use of whole-part diamonds, associations, multiplicities, etc?  Actions in app mapped to methods? Not overly data-centric or other design flaws?)
Good. Add some detail to the Scraper entities.

### Architecture
[5 points]  (Well fleshed-out in terms of libraries/frameworks needed?  Described well and pictured if it is not standard?)
Descriptive.

### Initial code
[15 points]  (Challenging libraries in fact prototyped?  Server stood up and some basic code written?  Frontend prototyped? 100+ lines of original code, not just pasting in a tutorial?)
Done.

#### Initial commit made
[5 points]  (did every group member commit at least once to the repo as was required in the assignment?)
Yes.

### Other General issues / remarks, including non-CRUD features
[10 points]
Looks OK.

**Grade: 92/100**
